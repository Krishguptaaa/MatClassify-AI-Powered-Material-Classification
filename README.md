🧪 MatClassify: AI-Powered Material Classification
📌 Overview

MatClassify is an interactive web application developed using Streamlit that leverages machine learning to classify materials based on their mechanical properties. Users can input values for Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), Yield Strength (YS), and Elongation, and the app will predict the material type along with a detailed description.
